Cryptid
=======
An indie horror game set in a labyrinthine old mansion which is also inhabited by a demonic presence which can take human canine and Darkness? forms. The main aim is to create an immersive sound driven experience where the player can feel the things around it and the game is meant to be an experience to play. The player should feel at the mercy of the game.

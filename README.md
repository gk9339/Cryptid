Cryptid
=======
An indie horror game set in a labyrinthine old mansion which is also inhabited by a demonic presence that resulted from a cult trying to create a manifestation of god in a human body. The main aim is to create an immersive sound driven experience where the player can feel the things in the environment around them and the game is meant to be an experience to play where the player should feel at the mercy of the game.
